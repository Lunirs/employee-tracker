## Description

The purpose in creating this application was for users who would like an easily accessible database for all of the employees in the users' company.

Being able to track and modify as employees have their roles changed, new departments are added, new roles are added, managerial shifts, and even employees departing the company.

This project currently only supports viewing (all employees, all departments, all roles), adding (new roles, departments, employees), and updating existing employees' roles.

Further development of this project will support departure of employees, management changes, etc.
